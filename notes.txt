NOTES

These are just running notes, or what the Rubber Duck would hear.
They don't have to make sense, but could still be useful.

Principles:
    The library provides parts only
    The project puts them together
    The project is driving the library
    The library is not driving the project
    The library makes no assumptions about the project

Decisions:
    The library is built together with the project?
        - No, too much 
OR
    The library is built separately with appropriate parameters.
    The project can be built with other parameters.
    We build library once, as we need it, and we can share it between projects
        - YES
OR
    We build the library together with the project, but in the project directory
    I.e. one library build per project
        - No, too much build overhead

The library accepts the following when building:
    ...

The problem could be that files for some targets can only be compiled with
certain options. The solution could be providing a separate Makefile for each
target to build the library with default options set.

Then how do we build the library with support for multiple targets?

If they're compatible, they would share common pieces of Makefiles
